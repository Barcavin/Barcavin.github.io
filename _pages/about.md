Hey folks. I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Nitesh Chawla](https://niteshchawla.nd.edu/). Before that, I worked as a data scientist at [Aunalytics](https://www.aunalytics.com/). I received my Master degree in Statistics at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://stat.illinois.edu/), and my Bachelor degree in Mathematics at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in graph machine learning, representation learning and data science. I am currently working on the problem of graph representation learning, and its applications in link prediction. I also like building data-driven applications that can help people make better decisions.

Cheers!


# What's New

- [2024.09] My work [MPLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00976) got accepted to Neurips'24!
- [2024.05] Excited to start my summer internship as a research scientist at Intuit.
- [2024.04] We propose a family of Trainless GNNs that can be fitted on graphs **without** gradient descent. See preprint at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11019).
- [2024.02] As a step towards graph foundation models, we propose a Universal Link Prediction model (UniLP) that can be applied to any unseen new graphs without training. See preprint at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07738). It is also discussed in a recent [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/foundation-models-in-graph-geometric-deep-learning-f363e2576f58) about graph foundation models.
- [2023.09] We study whether GNNs can count Common Neighbors for link prediction tasks, and propose a novel link prediction model, MPLP, which only leverages message passing to estimate structural features. See preprint at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00976).
- [2022.11] Our paper about link prediction is accepted to LOG’22. [Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QDN0jSXuvtX)
- [2022.11] Our paper about self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graph is accepted to AAAI’23. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09957)
- [2021.08] Started my first year at Notre Dame!
- [2021.06] One paper was accepted at [ECML PKDD 2021](https://2021.ecmlpkdd.org/index.html). [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86517-7_21)
