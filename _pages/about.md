Hey folks. I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Nitesh Chawla](https://niteshchawla.nd.edu/). Before that, I worked as a data scientist at [Aunalytics](https://www.aunalytics.com/). I received my Master degree in Statistics at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://stat.illinois.edu/), and my Bachelor degree in Mathematics at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in graph machine learning, representation learning and data science. I am currently working on the problem of graph representation learning, and its applications in link prediction. I also like building data-driven applications that can help people make better decisions.

Cheers!
